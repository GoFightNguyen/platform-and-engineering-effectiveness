# [Why you should invest in good Developer Experience today](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/why-you-should-invest-good-developer-experience-today)

> __Developer Experience (DX)__ encompasses all aspects of the developer's interaction with the organization, its tools and systems.

Engineers have a gap in the amount of time they want to spend on value-adding activities and the amount of time they actually do.
A portion of the gap is caused by operations, which has mostly been addressed through DevOps and Continuous Delivery.

Another portion of that gap is caused by poor DXs: poor DX => low engineering effectiveness.


## How bad DX looks
When engineers are bound to bad DXs, the gap is widened.

Here are common patterns of a bad DX:
- non-automatable (GUI) interfaces of provided tools and systems binding the engineers to manual, non-value-added activities
- hardware and infrastructure is often scarce and hard to get
- tedious onboarding and setup
- fragmented team structures: hand-offs
- a lack of enablement: APIs, libraries or platforms without guidance, examples, and shared knowledge


## How you can achieve a good DX
- adopt product thinking for technical products and platforms
- see engineers as customers
  - identify constraints and problems in the engineering journey as an opportunity to improve the DX; look for areas where the leverage of solving the problem is high
- identify and shorten feedback loops
- enable and encourage collaboration
- create a culture where team members feel safe to experiment and encouraged to innovate
